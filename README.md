# Face Detection and Recognition using Transfer Learning

In this project, we aim to develop a face detection and recognition model using the ResNet50 architecture as our base model and transfer learning by adding a few layers. Our results show that the fine-tuned ResNet50 model outperforms the original ResNet50 model on our face recognition task. Hence we plan to deploy it in an automated attendance framework.

## Requirements

  - CUDA-capable GPU
  - Python 3.8 and above
  - keras & Tensorflow
  - Visual Studio Code (1.772) [optional]

## Running this project

To run this project, follow these steps:

  - clone the repository onto your local desktop
  - open VS Code or any other IDE in the same directory
  - change the path names of the datasets
       - in `AT&T.ipynb` change it to `AT&T Database of Faces`
       - in `FaceScrub.ipynb` change it to `FaceScrubDataset`
       
  - run the notebooks
